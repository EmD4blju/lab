# Lab

This repository is my personal experiments and playground for exploring various technologies and concepts.

## Purpose

This is a workspace where I experiment with different tools, frameworks, and ideas including:
- Vector databases (ChromaDB)
- LangChain and LangGraph
- Flask web applications
- Python development practices

Feel free to explore the code, but note that this is an experimental repository and code may be in various states of completion.
